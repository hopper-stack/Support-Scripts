~ What is Hopper~Stack ~

The Hopper~Stack provides an automated installation of the core OpenStack components together with optionally selected support services. 

We designed Hopper~Stack to keep up-to-date with the fast paced releases of OpenStack, giving engineers a method of understanding and implementing their own OpenStack environments.

With an aggressive OpenStack release period of 6 months, Hopper~Stack provides BOTH a minimal and advanced installation via standard BASH-Shell scripts to help engineers understand how to build simple or complex environments. 

Using Hopper~Stack, Stackers will be able to learn and develop their own skills and roll out their own versions of OpenStack.

Essentially Hopper~Stack tries to tutor engineers in creating their own cloud offerings using OpenStack.

With shell scripts, many Linux engineers will understand the code easily ~ for others, simply running the scripts and following the guides will still allow them to build environments and gain various OpenStack skills over a period of time. 

Additional Opensource software can also be configured using Hopper~Stack and helps the reader to build an environment as an offering using what we consider some of the best Opensource software available.

Hopper-Stack is designed around CentOS but also installs readily on the popularly used RedHat.

We intend releasing the simplified installation which is based purely on the installation guide, within 2 weeks of the official OpenStack release. However, for the more complex build which also delivers a support service around OpenStack, we will attempt to deliver within 4 weeks.
